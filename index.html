        So yeah I went to the Peterson museme recently and it kinda
        reignited my love for cars again. Seeing all those builds in
        person was wild honestly. Some of them didnt even look real.

        Ever since then I been watching random vids and learning more
        stuff about engines and builds. I probly dont understand half
        of it yet but its fun. I think about cars way more now.

        Hopefully one day I land a job around cars somehow. Even just
        being near that world would be sick. For now I’m just enjoying
        learning and staying into it.
