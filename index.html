      So yeah I’ve always liked cars but I went to the Peterson museme
      recently and it kinda reignited everything again. Seeing all those
      builds in person was crazy. Some of them didnt even look real.

      Ever since then I been watching random vids and looking stuff up
      about engines and builds and all that. I dont know everything yet
      but its fun learning. I probly spend too much time thinking about
      cars now honestly.

      Hopefully one day I can get a job somewhere in that world. Even if
      its not building them, just being around cars would be sick. For now
      I’m just enjoying the hobby and seeing where it goes.
